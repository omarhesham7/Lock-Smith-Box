# Lock Smith Box
- Designed a safe that doubled as a cookie jar which locked/unlocked with a solenoid mechanism, using embedded C language to code the STM32F0 microcontroller.

- A locking system that is triggered only by correctly answering a set of mathematical expressions, with each answer being a digit to the passcode responsible for unlocking the solenoid.

- Integrated an alarm system for the safe that is triggered in the case of supplying a wrong input, inputting multiple answers consecutively, or if the user fails to input an answer within an allocated time frame.
